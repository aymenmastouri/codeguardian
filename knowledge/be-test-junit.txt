Write a JAVA unit test class - thereby:

Respect that we are using:
- JAVA 17
- SpringBoot 3.4.x
- Hibernate Data Access
- JUnit 5

While writing tests
- ensure we cover each public method
- ensure we cover all branches within each method
- ensure we cover all used private functions including there branches
- ensure we cover multiple value input scenarios not forgetting edge cases (eg NULL, empty, MAX_LENGTH, -1)

While writing tests      
- ensure each tests has a good short and concise description using @DisplayName("<use tested methodName here> - <use description here so a read know what is tested herein in one simple sentence>")
- ensure each test name is prefixed with "test", then method name, then keyword hints to test case all in camelCase
- ensure you write rough comments in Gherkin style with uppercase GIVEN, WHEN, THEN aligned with the corresponding code implementation

Ensure the test class is well-structured and follows JUnit testing best practices.
