Write a Jasmine unit test class for the following Angular TypeScript code

The test class should include multiple `describe` blocks:
- One for the tested class itself
  - within class test one for "code tests"
    - within "code tests" one for each tested function
  - within class tests one for "ui element related tests"

While writing tests
- ensure we cover all branches
- ensure we cover edge classes

While writing tests
- ensure you write rough comments in Gherkin style with uppercase GIVEN, WHEN, THEN aligned with the corresponding code implementation

Ensure the test class is well-structured and follows Angular testing best practices.
